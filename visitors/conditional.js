// TODO: runs on file content and package name:
// on file content, finds conditional compiler instructions like [IF IE9] or [IF CHROME] and only keeps the blocks corresponding to a flag passed in the config
// on package name, append the flag name
// Then up to the user to run packman as many times as he wants flag-dependent (most of the time browser) packages ;-)
