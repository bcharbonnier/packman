- add a --watch option to run in the background and package when a file is saved (fs.watch doesn's work that great ...)
- command line `pakman` rather than node path/to/pakman
- npm dependencies
- implement the conditional visitor
- implement a simple versioning visitor (based on a version tag given in cfg, put all destination files in a new /tag/ directory to avoid having to repeat this tag throughout the cfg)
- implement the special AT visitors ....
